# Genetic Algorithms
Code implemented to implement and evaluate genetic algortihms 

## Overview

This project focuses on two genetic algorithms: the first algorithm  
is used to find a target number within a set range of values and the 
second is used to optimise a set of parameters for the curve of a 5th 
order polynomial

## Project Structure 

1. find_target.py - implements first genetic algortihm to find target number within a given range
2. polynomial_parameters.py - implements second genetic algortihm to optimise a set of parameters for polynomial curve
