# Genetic Algorithms

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing two genetic algorithms for two different 
tasks. The first algorithm  is used to find a target number within a set range 
of values and the second is used to optimise a set of parameters for the curve 
of a 5th order polynomial. 

## Project Structure 

1. find_target.py - implements first genetic algortihm to find target number within a given range
2. polynomial_parameters.py - implements second genetic algortihm to optimise a set of parameters for polynomial curve
